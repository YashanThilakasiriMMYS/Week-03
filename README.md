## Classification Machine Learning Algorithms Part I - K Nearest Neighbors Classifier

In Week 03 we discussed about the KNN Classifier, which is one of the most simplest Supervised Type Classification Machine Learning Algorithm

### KNN Classifier

K Nearest Neighbor(KNN) is a very simple, easy to understand, versatile and one of the topmost machine learning algorithms.Â 
KNN used in the variety of applications such as finance, healthcare, political science, handwriting detection, image recognition and video recognition.
